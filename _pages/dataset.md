## Dataset with Babelio book reviews

The Data set is related to the PhD thesis “Crise de lecture : la lecture une idée neuve à l’ère du numérique ? Le cas des ouvrages de fiction et de leurs commentaires en ligne” (in English: “Reading crisis: reading, a new idea in the digital age? The case of fiction works and their online comments”).

The object of research is the exploration of a sample of literary reviews from the platform of a French-speaking network for readers, Babelio. The explored reviews are about *Les hommes qui n’aimaient pas les femmes* (Stieg Larsson, 2006), *Fun Home : une tragicomédie familiale* (Alison Bechdel, 2006) and *Soumission* (Michel Houellebecq, 2015).

The methodology deployed a quali-quantitative and computer-assisted approach. The digital tools include a project-internal MySQL database and text analysis via the software [Iramuteq](http://www.iramuteq.org). In addition, manual annotation of terms from the reviews was undertaken to produce a list containing terms and contexts that evoke a reading experience. The annotation uses several notions: reader subject, medium, session, content, reception and further subcategories.
The data set contains, among other things, the reviews in original version and a version prepared for text mining with Iramuteq, as well as the annotated list of terms.

The dataset is published on Zenodo: Cora Krömer, “Expériences de lecture – Babelio (Version 1.0.0) [Data set]”, in: *Zenodo* [online], Oct. 2020, DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.4066684](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4066684).
