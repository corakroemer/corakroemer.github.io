## Education

<!-- Dr Cora F. Krömer -->
Cora F. Krömer studied Romance Philology and European Art History (BA) at Heidelberg University (2012), French-German Studies: Cross-border Communication and Cooperation (trinational MA) at Saarland University, University of Lorraine and University of Luxembourg (2014). She holds a PhD in French Literature/Romance Studies from Le Mans University ([3L.AM laboratory](http://3lam.univ-lemans.fr/fr/index.html)) and Saarland University (2020). For her thesis about reading in the digital age, she analysed online reviews about three fictional works from Babelio, a francophone network for readers. The methodology included a MySQL database, the text analysis software Iramuteq and manual annotation in order to detect and classify reading experiences.

## Research interests

Cora F. Krömer's research focus is on reading in the digital age, reading experiences and recently reading emotions. Her methodological focus is on quantitative methods of text analysis. In terms of material, she is focusing on social media posts, e.g. reviews from Babelio, Goodreads and LovelyBooks but also Twitter. She is also interested in new forms of scholarly publishing like Jupyter Notebooks. Open Access/Open Science in the Humanities and research data management are very important topics to her. She is currently developing her IT and coding skills, mostly in Python and R for data/text analysis and visualisation.
