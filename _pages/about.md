Dr Cora Krömer studied Romance philology and European Art History (BA) at Heidelberg University (2012), French-German Studies: Crossboarder Communication and Communication (trinational MA) at Saarland University, University of Lorraine and Luxembourg University (2014). She holds a Ph.D in Romance Studies from Le Mans University and Saarland University (2020). For her thesis about reading at the digital age, she analysed online reviews about three fictional works from Babelio. The methodology included a MySQL database, the text analysis software Iramuteq and manual annotation in order to detect and classify reading experiences. 

Cora Krömer's research focus is on reading in the digital age, reading experiences, reading emotions. She is interested to develop skills in Python and R.

PS.: I love reading, cycling, hiking, swimming, painting and sculpting.
