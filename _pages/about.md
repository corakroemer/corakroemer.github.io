## Education

<!-- Dr Cora F. Krömer -->
Cora F. Krömer studied Romance Philology <!--(https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/rose/studium/bachelor/allg_praesent_ba_fra.html)--> and European Art History <!-- (https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/de/studium/alle-studienfaecher/europaeische-kunstgeschichte/europaeische-kunstgeschichte-bachelor-25)--> (BA) at Heidelberg University <!-- (https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/de)--> (2012), French-German Studies: Cross-border Communication and Cooperation <!-- https://www.uni-saarland.de/studium/angebot/master/dfs.html) --> (trinational MA) at Saarland University<!--(https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html)-->, University of Lorraine <!--(https://www.univ-lorraine.fr)--> and University of Luxembourg <!--(https://wwwfr.uni.lu)--> (2014). She holds a PhD in French Literature/Romance Studies from Le Mans University <!--http://www.univ-lemans.fr/fr/index.html--> ([3L.AM laboratory](http://3lam.univ-lemans.fr/fr/index.html))<!--and Saarland University (2020): *Doctorat en Langue, littératures françaises et littératures francophones* from Le Mans University and *Dr. phil. in Französische Kulturwissenschaft und interkulturelle Kommunikation* from Saarland University-->. For her [thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03199594) about reading in the digital age, she analysed online reviews about three fictional works from [Babelio](https://www.babelio.com), a francophone network for readers. The methodology included a MySQL database, the text analysis software [Iramuteq](http://www.iramuteq.org) and manual annotation in order to detect and classify reading experiences.

She is currently working as coordinator for "bwFDM" (Federal State Initiative for research data management in Baden-Württemberg) at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in the KIT-Library (Research Services). "bwFDM" promotes the exchange between RDM actors in Baden-Württemberg and beyond by coordinating working groups on cross-cutting topics and joining (inter)national networks, supports the information plattform [forschungsdaten.info](https://forschungsdaten.info), offers trainings, webinars and a certificate course in the future, organizes the [E-Science-Tage](https://e-science-tage.de/en), aims to establish the brand "bwFDM" and will coordinate the implementation of Baden-Württemberg's research data strategy.

From 2021 to 2023, she was working as research associate for the pilot project "[eHumanities -- interdisziplinär](https://www.fdm-bayern.org/projekte/ehumanities-interdisziplinaer/)" (2018-2023) at the University Library Erlangen-Nuremberg (Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg). eHumanities -- interdisziplinär is developing new tools, support methods and best practice recommendations (i.e. DataCite, RDMO) for research data management and provides the website [fdm-bayern.org](https://www.fdm-bayern.org). From 2022 to 2023, Cora was also engaged in the [LaVe](https://www.fdm-bayern.org/projekte/lave/)-project (2022-2023) dedicated at long term-archiving for research data.

## Research interests

Cora F. Krömer's research focus is on reading in the digital age, reading experiences and reading emotions. Her methodological focus is on quantitative methods for text analysis. In terms of material, she is focusing on social media posts, e.g. reviews from Babelio, Goodreads and LovelyBooks. She is also interested in new forms of scholarly publishing like Jupyter Notebooks. Open Access/Open Science in the Humanities and research data management are very important topics to her. She is currently developing her IT and coding skills, mostly in Python for data/text analysis and visualisation.

**Keywords**: reading studies, literature, computational literary studies, text analysis, research data, open science.
