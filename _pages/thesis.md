## Reading crisis: reading, a new idea in the digital age? The case of fiction books and their online comments

### Abstract

Digital technology is transforming the production, circulation and reception of written culture. These changes provide an opportunity to examine reading practices, whose decline is regularly deplored, and the pivotal moment in HSS--new objects, terrains and methods--that this examination confronts us with. Starting from the question, still unanswered–-*why and how do people read?*–-this thesis analyses ordinary reading experiences shared through reviews posted on the online reader community, Babelio. It tests the potentialities and limits of an *ad hoc* methodology, a mixed-methods approach deploying quali-quantitative and computer-assisted methods (database and text mining). The use of preliminary work on reading and literary exchanges, coming from various disciplines in the humanities, enables a deeper understanding of the new modalities associated with the phenomenon of *reading in the digital age*.  The confrontation of critical commentaries with theoretical notions on the act and effects of reading makes it possible to: underline the importance and taste for online sharing of readers as well as its commercial exploitation by social networks dedicated to this cultural activity; verify the experimental value of the concepts of cooperation between text and reader, of immersion, and of pleasures of reading on printed media. Thus, in the digital literary sphere, it is not necessarily reading itself that proves to be a new idea, but rather the possibility of sharing between peers within specific online communities.

### Summary

The title of the thesis alludes to a question about the consequences of digital technology for reading. With increasing importance in our lives, the development of digital technology is seen by some as a revolution[^1] which feeds old concerns about a book crisis and a reading crisis: the printed book would be replaced by fragments of digital texts, the reading practice would decrease, the mode of attentive and critical reading would be replaced by superficial and fragmented reading, etc. This general concern, represented by the term “crisis” in the title, is not new (it dates back long before digital technology influenced our everyday lives) and takes many forms, including surveys, books, book chapters, scientific and journalistic articles and blog entries. The work is based on a questioning of the often defeatist discourses on the mutations of reading in the digital age.

Reading in the digital age, as considered in this thesis, is not so much a new idea generated by digital technology as an activity enriched by new forms. The digital in the title is not to be considered as a “technical object”: In the digital age, readers can leave new (written) reading testimonies, such as online comments. In a context where the value of contemporary reading practices is questioned, the contribution of new empirical sources--online comments shared by ordinary readers—should be highlighted and examined. More than on reading practices themselves, the comments give us access to personal reading experiences that are publicly shared: Not the act of reading, but the subsequent discourse is observed. The collection and analysis of online reviews is also a significant step forward in the research and understanding of reading experiences and written culture in the digital age.

As Robert Darnton points out in his article “First Steps Toward a History of Reading” from 1986, we have answers to the questions of *who* is reading *what*, *where* and *when*, but the *why* and *how* we read is still a matter of concern.[^2] Online comments sharing reading experiences seem to be relevant sources when trying to explore aspects of contemporary reading. The online comments examined for this thesis are a selection of comments from ordinary readers who have shared them in the largest francophone online reading community, Babelio. The comments, named ‘reviews’ (“*Critiques*”) on the Babelio site, refer to *Les hommes qui n’aimaient pas les femmes*[^3] by Stieg Larsson, *Fun Home : une tragicomédie familiale*[^4] by Alison Bechdel and *Soumission*[^5] by Michel Houellebecq.

The thesis pursues two objectives: On the one hand, it is about online comments on books and reading, about the publication contexts--especially on the Babelio platform--their forms, content and the reading experiences shared through them. On the other hand, the aim is to construct and apply a qualitative-quantitative mixed-methods methodology, to describe it in detail to enable the reproducibility of the results, and to serve as documentation of the application of a database and text statistics software, Iramuteq. This software is rarely used for the analysis of reading comments. Finally, its relevance for the analysis of comments and thus its ability to answer questions about the *why* and *how* of reading in the digital age has to be tested. There is no ready-made method for text analysis: computer-assisted methods are in constant development, their application is only just beginning to become more general; specific methods must be developed by trial and error, leading to a trial-and-error approach which must start from the research sources. The aim is to show the potential and the limits of this methodology, its time-consuming implementation, but also its feasibility for literary scholars without previous knowledge of computer-assisted methods, such as text statistics or the query language SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying a MySQL database.

Methodologically, a decisive moment is experienced: on the one hand, computer-assisted methods have not yet found their proper place in the humanities; on the other hand, there is a paradigm shift in the humanities. Digital technology is questioning their epistemology, calling them into question as “disciplines”, transforming the conditions of knowledge production and circulation. Digital technology becomes a tool, a method, a field and an object of research. The thesis considers all the transformations that digital technology brings to literary studies: Its method consists in the use of digital tools; its field of research is the online reading community Babelio; it examines the reviews and their metadata as a research object; finally, the research data[^6] are made openly accessible on the internet.
